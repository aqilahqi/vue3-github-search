# vue3-github-search (in-progress)

Search github repositories using github API. User can mark a repo as favourite and view it in a favourite list.

I used `Vue 3`, `Vuetify`, `Pinia`, and `Axios`

Prototype is done in <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/VdCieLr8fdnDBMtHjZ4snf/Github-Search-App?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=1%3A2&viewport=384%2C1597%2C5.21&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=1%3A2&show-proto-sidebar=1" target="_blank">Figma</a>
